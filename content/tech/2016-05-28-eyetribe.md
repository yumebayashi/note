EyeTribe is the world's first affordable eye tracker.  
It enables us to get the eye movement trajectories and develop some tools with it.  
Today I'll show you a demo play.

The eyetribe sercer gives 30 fps data by default setting.  
The upper limit is 60 fps. I use default value.  
Every data can not return the coordinates of the point precisely.  
Moreover small eye movement in a moment can be a noise.  
I use Simple Moving Median to get current position for each 0.1 sec.  

```
private Point2D getMedian() {
    Arrays.sort(xs);
    Arrays.sort(ys);

    float x = (xs[14] + xs[15]) / 2;
    float y = (ys[14] + ys[15]) / 2;

    return new Point2D(x, y);
}
```

In my display (1440x900), I think 9 blocks is the upper limit of detecting the eye position.
